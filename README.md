# Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver
I have created this project using Backtraking method to Solve Sudoku Puzzle Game.

Backtracking Algorithm : Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree)

In this Sudoku puzzle, we try filling digits one by one. Whenever we find that current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit. This is better than naive approach.
